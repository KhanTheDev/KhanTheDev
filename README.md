# 👋 Hi, I’m Haris Khan — `@KhanTheDev`

🚀 I'm a Computer Science student at Brooklyn College (Class of 2027) with a passion for building intelligent, accessible software that drives impact.

From automating admin systems to building AI-powered tools and cybersecurity defenses, I love creating things that make life easier and more secure. I’ve interned in both nonprofit and startup settings and love the fast, feedback-driven nature of product work.
